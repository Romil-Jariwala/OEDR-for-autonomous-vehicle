# Depth Estimation

## About Depth Estimation
Depth estimation refers to the techniques used for calculating of the spatial arangement of different objects present in a scene. Depth estimation or calculating the distance between the autonomous vehicle and the detected objects is a crucial step in maneuvering the vehicle in a safe and efficient manner. 

In our project, we have used Stereo depth estimation to triangulate and locate the detected objects.
