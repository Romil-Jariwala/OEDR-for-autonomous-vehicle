## Features of Euclidean Clustering
We have used the Euclidean clustering algorithm to group the point cloud data generated by LIDAR which in-turn is used for object detection.
This algorithm starts by choosing a single point, then increasing the cluster size by including all the points that that fall under the euclidean distance threshold and it reiterates till the cluster can no longer be increased in size. This process is repeated till all the points are included in a cluster.

The implementation of the Euclidean clustering algorithm can divided into the following steps,
1. Extracting the point cloud data
	The data from the PCD format of the LIDAR is extracted and the data is then down-sampled to achieve better performance.
2. Variable selection: 
	In this step the variables such as minimum cluster size, maximum cluster size and cluster tolerance are set.
3. Clustering: 
	After setting up the variables, the above mentioned algorithm is used to extract the different clusters from the given point cloud and saved into different cluster files/variables for any further potential uses.
