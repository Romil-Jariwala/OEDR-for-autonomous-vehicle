# Lane Detection Subsystem

## About
This module is dedicated to detecting lane and calculting its radius of curvature

## Architecture
The workflow of this subsystem is divided into the following steps:
1. Pre-processing
2. Edge detection
3. Perspective transform
4. Histogram-based search
5. Calculating the radius of curvature
